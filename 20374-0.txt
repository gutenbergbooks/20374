CAPITALS




INTRODUCTION


A capital letter is a letter of formal shape. Capitals were originally
derived from the stiff and angular letters used in formal inscriptions.
Originally all writing was done in capitals. Later the scribes devised
less formal shapes for the letters, making use of lines more easily made
by brush or pen on papyrus, parchment, or paper. The capitals were
retained for certain uses but the less formal shapes were employed to do
the greater part of the work. These less formal letters have been known
by several names. They will be referred to here by that under which they
are known to modern printers, "lower-case."

A further modification of the letter came with the introduction of the
sloping, or italic letter. This received its name from its place of
origin, Italy. It was introduced by Nicholas Jenson, a printer of
Venice, and was an imitation of the handwriting of the Italian poet
Petrarch. Originally it was used only for the lower-case and was
combined with the older form of capital letters, called roman, also from
the place of its origin. Later the italic characteristics were given to
capitals as well as lower-case letters.

An ordinary font of book type contains five series of letters: full
capitals, small capitals, italic capitals (full size), roman lower-case,
and italic lower-case. The full capital, roman or italic, is larger than
the other letters of the font, every letter being as high as the
lower-case ascenders. The small capital is only as high as the
lower-case round letters. Larger capitals still are sometimes used as
chapter initials and the like.

It will be observed that the distinction between capital and lower-case
letters is one of form, not of size. The full capitals being much more
used than the small capitals and being larger than the other letters in
the font, the impression is common that the size is the distinguishing
mark. This erroneous impression has even crept into dictionary
definitions.

The full capital, which will hereafter be called in this book simply the
capital, is used in combination with lower-case letters or with small
capitals in the same word. The small capital is not used in combination
with lower-case in the same word. We may print GEORGE WASHINGTON, GEORGE
WASHINGTON, GEORGE WASHINGTON, or George Washington, but not George
Washington.

In manuscript capitals are indicated by three lines under a word or
letter, [Symbol: triple line] and small capitals by two lines [Symbol:
double line]. A single line [Symbol: single underline] indicates that
italics are to be used.

Originally the writers of manuscripts used capitals for ornament and
variety in the text. They followed no rules but each writer was guided
by his own judgment and sense of beauty. As the use of capitals
gradually became systematized and reduced to rules, different systems
were adopted in different countries. The use of capitals varies greatly
in different languages. Attention will be mainly confined in this book
to the usages followed in the printing of English. Attempts to point out
the various differences to be found in German, French, etc. would only
confuse the young apprentice.

These rules grow out of a fundamental principle.

The purpose of capitals is to emphasize the words in which they are
employed. With the exception of the cases of the words _I_ and _O_,
which are capitalized for typographical reasons, this idea of calling
special attention to a word, or words, for one reason or another will be
found to be at the bottom of the variations in usage in different
printing offices and by different writers. The same tendency is
observable here which is so evident in style and in punctuation. Direct
statements, simple sentences as free from involution and complication as
possible, are more and more taking the place of the involved,
complicated, and obscure sentences of old times. The ideal style of
to-day consists of simple words simply arranged. Such a style needs
little pointing. The reader is quite able to find his way through the
paragraph without constant direction. Punctuation marks are directions
at the crossroads of thought. Consequently the punctuation mark is now
much more sparingly used than formerly.

Just as we have found out that well chosen words can tell their story
with very few marks of interpretation so we have found out that they can
tell their story with very few marks of emphasis. The use of capitals
has decreased greatly during the last two centuries and is constantly
decreasing, and this tendency is likely to go still further. The great
DeVinne whose books on _The Practice of Typography_, written ten to
fifteen years ago, are still of the highest authority was thoroughly
up-to-date in his methods and was remarkable for the restrained and
refined good taste which characterized all his recommendations, but in
some points restraint in the use of capitals has gone even beyond his
precepts.

It is worth while to remember that the real implement of English speech
is the word, not the point nor the letter form. Just to the extent that
we rely on marks of punctuation and emphasis to convey our meaning we
betray our ignorance of the really significant elements of the language.
The schoolgirl says she "had a _perfectly splendid_ time" at the dance,
when she tells about it in her letter to her dearest friend. If
"perfectly splendid" were a proper term to use in such a connection,
which it is not, the words themselves would carry all the emphasis
possible. Nothing could really be added to them by any typographical
device. In the same way the common use of profanity among ignorant
people probably arises mainly from a feeling that the ordinary words
with which they are familiar are colorless and do not express their
thoughts with sufficient emphasis.

Just as emphasis in style is difficult when one habitually uses the
strongest words and emphasis in voice is difficult when one habitually
shouts, so emphasis in print is difficult when one habitually uses large
capitals, display type, and italics. Loud printing is as objectionable
as loud talking.




USE OF FULL CAPITALS


General uses:

1. Use a capital letter to begin every sentence and every word or group
of words punctuated as a sentence.

    _Welcome! We are glad to see you._

This rule does not apply to literal reproductions of matter not
originally conforming to it.

2. Use a capital letter to begin every line of poetry.

    _The Lord hates a quitter,
    But he doesn't hate him, son,
    When the quitter's quitting something
    He shouldn't have begun.       [that_

This rule does not apply to turned over lines like the third line in the
stanza just preceding.

3. Use a capital letter to begin every quotation consisting of a
complete sentence.

    _Ben Franklin says, "Honesty is the best policy."_
    _The campaign was "a punitive expedition for the suppression of
    brigandage."_


Capitalize:

1. Names of the Deity, of the members of the Trinity, of the Virgin
Mary, and of the Devil, when a personal devil is referred to.

When the word devil is used as a general term or as an expletive the
capital is not used.

2. Nouns and adjectives used to designate the Deity or any member of the
Trinity:

    _the Almighty_, _the Ruler of the Universe_, _the Supreme Architect
    of the Universe_, _the Creator_, _Providence_ (personified),
    _Heaven_ (personified, e. g., _Heaven forbid!_), _Father_, _Son_,
    _Holy Ghost_, _Spirit_, _Messiah_, and the like.

The following list of words of this sort to be capitalized, taken from
Mr. William Dana Orcutt's _The Writer's Desk Book_ (Frederick A. Stokes,
New York) will be found useful:

    Almighty
    Authorized Version
    Common Version
    Creator
    Deity
    Father
    God
    Holy Bible
    Holy Spirit
    Holy Writ
    Jehovah
    Jesus Christ
    King
    Logos
    Lord
    Messiah
    Passover
    Pentecost
    Redeemer
    Revised Version
    Sabbath
    Saviour
    Scriptures
    Son of Man
    Son
    Spirit
    The Trinity
    The Virgin Mary
    Word

Care needs to be taken with words of this class. Particular attention
should be paid to the wording of rule 2, just given. The same words in
other senses or other connections are not capitalized. _Heaven_ and
_hell_ and derived adjectives are not capitalized in their ordinary
uses:

Adjectives and other derivatives from these words are not capitalized.
We write _Messiah_, but _messianic_ and _messiahship_; _Christology_ but
_christological_, _fatherhood_, _sonship_, and the like.

Such words as _deity_, _god_, and the like are not capitalized where any
but the God of the Bible is referred to.

3. Pronouns referring to God, Christ, or the Holy Spirit in direct
address or where there might otherwise be ambiguity.

These pronouns are not capitalized in the Bible. They are generally
capitalized in hymn books and books of devotion. These pronouns were
formerly all capitalized as a mark of respect to God whenever there was
any mention of him, even indirect. The tendency is more and more to
eliminate them except in the second person (direct address). In view of
the change now going on it is best to follow copy if the author appears
to have decided preferences.

4. Books, divisions, and versions of the Bible.

    _Book of Job_, _Twenty-third Psalm_,
    _New Testament_, _Revised Version_.

5. General biblical terms and titles of parables.

    _The Law_, _The Prophets_, _Major and Minor Prophets_ (referring to
    the collections of prophetic books), _Lord's Prayer_, _Lord's
    Supper_, _Parable of the Prodigal Son_, _the Beatitudes_, _the
    Priestly Code_ and many other such terms.

Use lower-case for _biblical_ and _scriptural_.

6. Capitalize _Holy_ in _Holy place_ and _Holy of holies_.
Say _Gospel of John_, but speak of the _gospel message_.

7. The names of religious bodies and their followers.

    _Catholic_, _Protestant_, _Unitarian_, _Methodist_, _Buddhists_,
    _Taoists_, _Lamas_.

8. The names of monastic orders and their followers.

    _Jesuits_, _Brothers of the Common Life_, _Recollets_, _Crutched
    Friars_, _Cowley Fathers_.

9. The word Church when it stands for the Church universal or is a part
of the name of some particular denomination or organization.

    _For salvation he sought the Church._
    _The Church of Rome._
    _The First Presbyterian Church._
    _I was on my way to church._
    _He is a student of church history._ (Note use of lower-case in
    this sentence.)

10. The names of creeds and professions of faith.

    _Apostle's Creed_, _Thirty-nine Articles_, _Nicene Creed_.

Note that the adjective ante-Nicene is printed as it here appears.

11. The word "father" when used in direct reference to the fathers of
the church, and to the Pilgrim leaders of New England, and the word
"reformers" when used of the leaders of the Reformation.

    _The ante-Nicene Fathers._
    _Luther, Calvin and the other Reformers._

The word "father" is not capitalized when the reference is general, as
in the first sentence of this section.

The capitalization of "reformer" is intended to distinguish persons
connected with a certain definite historical movement from persons
interested in reform. Many persons might consider that the Reformers
were not reformers.

12. Names of persons.

    _John Smith,_
    _George V._

But write _John o' Groat_, _Tam o' Shanter_, and the like where _o'_ is
an abbreviation of _of_ and not the Gælic _O'_ as _O'Neil_, etc.

In writing foreign names which contain particles, capitalize the
particles when not preceded by a Christian name or title.

    _Alfred de Musset_ but _De Musset_,
    _le Due de Morny_ but _De Morny_,
    _Prince von Bismarck_ but _Von Bismarck_.

By exception the Dutch particle "van" is always capitalized.

    _Van Hoorn_, _Stephen Van Rensselær_.

13. Epithets appended to proper names or substituted for them.

    _Frederick the Great_
    _Peter the Hermit_
    _William Red Head (Rufus)_
    _the Conqueror_.

14. Names of races of men.

    _Aryan_, _Caucasian_, etc., but generally _negro_ and _gypsy_, by
    exception.

15. Names of places.

a. Cities, rivers, oceans, lakes, mountains, etc.

    _Chicago_
    _Mississippi River_
    _Atlantic Ocean_
    _Lake Superior_
    _Pike's Peak_
    _Strawberry Hill_.

Note that the generic terms ocean, lake, mountain and the like are
capitalized only when they are an actual part of the name itself. We
would say "_The Atlantic Ocean lies east of the United States_," but we
would say "_The states which form the North American republic look out
on two great oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific._"

The following tables are taken from _A Manual for Writers_ by John
Matthews Manley and John Arthur Powell (University of Chicago Press,
Chicago).

Subject to the rule just stated, they will be found very useful.

Capitalize, in singular form only, when immediately following the name

    Archipelago
    Borough
    Branch (stream)
    Butte
    Canyon
    County
    Crater
    Creek
    Delta
    Forest
    Fork
    Gap
    Glacier
    Gulch
    Harbor
    Head
    Hollow
    Mesa
    Narrows
    Ocean
    Parish (La.)
    Park
    Plateau
    Range
    Reservation
    Ridge
    River
    Run

Capitalize in singular or plural form when immediately following the
name

    Hill
    Island
    Mountain
    Spring

Capitalize, in singular form, either before or after the name; and in
plural form before the name

    Bay
    Bayou
    Camp (military)
    Cape
    Dalles
    Desert
    Falls
    Fort
    Isle
    Lake
    Mount
    Oasis
    Pass
    Peak
    Point
    Port
    Sea
    Strait
    Valley
    Volcano

b. Names of streets, squares, parks, buildings, etc.

    _Amsterdam Avenue_
    _Van Buren Street_
    _Independence Square_
    _Lincoln Park_
    _Transportation Building_.

The same rule as to capitalization of the generic name holds here as in
the preceding section. The usual tendency to drop capitals is at work
here and newspapers now write _Washington street_ and _Federal
building_. It is very probable that the capitals will finally be dropped
from the generic terms wherever used.

Printers should keep a careful watch on the usage of the best offices so
as to keep advised as to the progress of these changes.

c. Nouns, and adjectives derived from them designating recognized
geographical divisions of a country or of the world.

    _East_, _West_, _North_, _South_,
    _Westerner_, _Oriental_.

When these words are used in their ordinary significance of mere
direction or location they are not capitalized except that in writing of
Biblical history we speak of the _Northern Kingdom_ and the _Southern
Kingdom_ into which Solomon's territory was split after his death.

16. Generic terms for political divisions.

a. When the term is part of the name and directly follows it.

    _Holy Roman Empire_
    _British Empire_
    _Northwest Territory_
    _Queen's County_.

b. When it is used with the preposition of in such phrases as _Borough
of the Bronx_, _Department of the Gulf_.

c. When part of a nickname, _The Crescent City_, _the Buckeye State_,
_the City of Brotherly Love_.

Be careful not to capitalize such words when they are not an actual part
of the name. _French Republic_ is the name of the county, exactly
translating _Republique Francaise_, but _American republic_ is not such
a name. You would write _State of New York_ in a legal document in which
the state would be considered as a corporate person, but in ordinary
references it would be _state of New York_.

17. The days of the week and the months of the year, but not the seasons
unless personified.

    _Monday the fifth of August._
    _April is the first month of spring._
    _Spring, beautiful Spring._

But write _ten o'clock_, _nine a.m._, _ten p.m._

18. Festivals and historic or famous days.

    _Easter Day_
    _Fast Day_
    _Independence Day_
    _Black Friday_.

19. Stars, planets, constellations, and the like, except _sun_, _moon_,
_stars_, _earth_.

    _Mars_, _the Milky Way_, _the Pleiades_.

20. Ordinal numbers used to designate numbered political divisions,
sessions of Congress, names of regiments, Egyptian dynasties, and the
like.

    _Second Congressional District_,
    _First Ward_, _Ninth Precinct_, _Forty-third
    Congress_, _Sixth Massachusetts Regiment_,
    _Fifth Dynasty_.

21. Names of genera but not of species: except that in botanical and
zoölogical copy the species may be capitalized if derived from a proper
name.

    _Agaricus campestris_
    _Parkinsonia Torreyana_
    _Pterygomatopus schmidti_, (Medical).

The English derivatives from these scientific words are not capitalized.
We write of the _agarics_, the _felids_, the _carnivores_, etc.

22. _Father_, _mother_, and other words denoting relationship when used
with a proper name or without a personal pronoun.

    _I saw Aunt Lucy and Cousin Charles._
    _I saw my aunt Lucy and my cousin Charles._
    _I have received a letter from my mother._
    _I have received a letter from Mother._

23. Names of political parties and of philosophical, literary, and
artistic schools, and their adherents.

    _Republican_, _National Liberal_, _Social Democrats_, _Stoics_ (but
    _neo-Platonism_, _pseudo-Christianity_, etc.) _the Lake school_,
    _the Romantic movement_, _the Symbolic school of painters_.

24. Political and historical designations which have been much used and
have come to have special significances such as names of leagues,
parties, classes, movements, and the like.

    _Holy Alliance_, _Dreibund_, _Roundheads_, _Independents_,
    _Reformation_, _Dissenter_.

25. Names of well-known historic epochs, periods in the history of
language, and geological ages and strata. The word "age" is not
capitalized except when necessary to avoid ambiguity.

    _Stone age_, _Middle Ages_, _Age of Elizabeth_, _Crusades_, _Commune
    (of Paris)_, _Middle English_, _Neolithic_.

26. Names of important events.

    _Hundred Years War_, _Battle of Trenton_,
    _Louisiana Purchase_, _Norman Conquest_.

27. Names of specific treaties, important laws, and the like.

    _Peace of Amiens_, _Edict of Nantes_, _Concordat_, _Emancipation
    Proclamation_, _Fourteenth Amendment_.

28. Names of governmental bodies and departments and their branches when
specifically designated.

    _Congress_, _the Senate_, _the Board of Aldermen_, _the House of
    Commons_, _the Committee on Education_.

Care must be taken to distinguish between these specific references and
general uses of the same word.

    _The state legislature of Massachusetts is officially termed the
    General Court._
    _The matter was referred to the War Department but was sent back on
    the ground that it belonged to another department._

29. The official titles of corporations, organizations, and
institutions, social, religious, educational, political, business, and
the like.

    _Knights Templars_, _Knights of Columbus_, _Associated Charities_,
    _Cook County Normal School_, _Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
    to Animals_, _Chicago_, _Rock Island and Pacific Railroad_.

In long titles, like the last example given, the important words are
capitalized as in book titles (see Sec. 31). Use capitals when referring
to such organizations by initials, _C. R. I. & P. R. R._ Here again it
must be remembered that the capitals are used in specific references
only.

    _The Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor of the Third
    Congregational Church._
    _The young people's societies connected with the Congregational
    churches do great good._

30. The names of conventions, congresses, expositions, etc.

    _Parliament of Religions_,
    _International Peace Congress_,
    _Panama-Pacific Exposition_.

31. The first words, principal words, and last word in English tides of
books and other publications; of their divisions (parts, chapters,
cantos, etc.); of the topics of speeches, sermons, toasts, and the like;
of pictures; of plays; of musical compositions, etc.

In long titles nouns and pronouns are capitalized always; verbs,
participles, and adverbs usually; articles, prepositions and
conjunctions never.

    _Standard Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases_, _Science and
    Health with Key to the Scriptures_, _Lincoln's Gettysburg Address_,
    _Paradise Lost_, _Measure for Measure_, _A New Way to Pay Old
    Debts_, _The Coronation of Charles VII at Rheims_, _the Moonlight
    Sonata_.

The word "the" is capitalized when it forms an actual part of the title
of a book but not otherwise.

    _The Printer's Dictionary_. _The Life and Times of Charles V._ _the
    Review of Reviews_, _the Laacoon_, _the Fifth Symphony_.

32. Dedications; headings of parts and chapters; headings of many
important minor parts of a book.

    _To All Who Love Good Printing._
    _Chapter Twenty-Seven._
    _Part Three._
    _The Invention of Movable Types._
    _The Practical Value of Gutenberg's Invention._
    (These last as sections of a book on the origin of printing).

33. In foreign languages the usage is somewhat different. The following
rules will be found useful:

a. Always capitalize the first word.

b. In Latin capitalize only proper nouns and adjectives derived
therefrom.

    _Commentarii Cæsaris de bello Gallico._

c. In French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and Norwegian, capitalize
proper names but not adjectives derived therefrom.

    _La vie de Ronsard_; _Histoire de la litterature francaise_,
    _Novelle e racconti popolari italiani_, _Antologia de poetas liricos
    castellanos_.

d. In German capitalize all nouns and all adjectives derived from the
names of persons but not those derived from other proper nouns.

    _Geschichte des deutsches Reich_
    _Die Homerische Frage_.

e. In Danish capitalize all nouns.

f. In Dutch capitalize all nouns and all adjectives derived from proper
nouns.

34. Titles of ancient manuscripts.

    _Codex Alexandrinus._

35. In titles of books, etc. all nouns forming parts of hyphenated
compounds should be capitalized.

36. In side heads capitalize the first word and proper nouns only.

37. Personal titles as follows:

a. Titles preceding a name and so forming part of it.

    _King George V._
    _Pope Benedict XV._
    _Duke William of Aquitaine._

But not otherwise.

    _Woodrow Wilson_, _president of the United States_, _the emperor of
    Germany_, _the present king of Spain is Alfonso XIII_.

b. Titles used in place of the name with reference to a particular
person or to the present holder of an office.

    _I hope when in Rome to see the Pope._
    _He hoped some day to become pope._

c. Familiar names applied to a particular person.

    _the Father of his Country._
    _Unser Fritz._
    _the Little Corporal._

d. Orders of knighthood and titles attached to them.

    _Knight of the Garter_,
    _Knight Commander of St. Michael and St. George_.

e. Titles used in direct address.

    _Good morning, Mr. President._

f. Academic degrees in abbreviated form following a name.

    _David Starr Jordan, Ph. D., LL. D._

So also letters following a name indicating membership of certain
scientific and artistic organizations.

    _F. R. G. S._ (Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society).
    _R. A._ (Member of the Royal Academy).

So also in the United States and Great Britain, _M. C._ (Member of
Congress) and _M. P._ (Member of Parliament).

Where a person has many titles the following of this rule involves
certain difficulties. Such a name as

    _John Smith, A. M., D. D., Ph. D., L. H. D., D. C. L., LL. D._ is by
    no means impossible.

In such a case the titles become much more prominent than the name and
the page is disfigured by the spotty appearance of the text. Small
capitals may sometimes be used with good effect in such a case but this
should not be done without obtaining proper permission.

The difficulty of handling these long and numerous titles in the
composition of title pages is sometimes considerable. Three methods of
dealing with the difficulty are open.

a. The honorary titles may be put in capitals regardless of the
unsightly appearance of the line.

b. The honorary titles may be put in a small size of the same face and
justified in the line. This lessens the undue prominence of the titles,
but puts the line out of balance.

c. The honorary titles may be put in a separate line, or lines, below
the name, set in small type, and spelled out in full. It is not
necessary to capitalize _jr._ and _sr._ in lower-case text matter unless
so desired by the author.

In compound titles capitalize each word if it would be capitalized

SMALL CAPITALS


The use of small capitals presents its own peculiar problems to the
printer. The small capital has the form of the large capital but without
its size and conspicuousness. The small capitals are ordinarily no
taller than the round letters of the lower-case. They are usually on a
smaller set, with a lighter face and obscured by more connecting lines.
In many fonts of type they are really the weakest and least
distinguished of all the five series. Wide enough to cover the body of
the type fairly thoroughly in most letters and thus to reduce the
apparent space between letters, without ascenders and without
descenders, they are very monotonous and singularly ineffective when
used in any considerable quantity. When used in masses it is at times
even difficult to read them.

The use of small capitals is quite different from that of large ones.
For the reasons just given they are not suited to display. For this
purpose they are no better than italics, if as good. Owing to their lack
of striking appearance and commanding quality they are not used for
emphasis. Display and emphasis it will be remembered are the two
principal uses of the full capital.

Small capitals are used more for variety than for display. They are
commonly used for:

    Side heads

    Running titles

    Catch lines of title pages when particular display is not desired.

They are sometimes used for the first word after a blank line,
especially for the first word of a new chapter.

Long quotations of poetry are often printed with the first word in small
capitals. In this, as in the preceding case, the whole word is printed
in small capitals except the first letter which is a full capital.

Proper names standing at the beginning of a chapter, occasionally even
of a paragraph, are sometimes spelled in capitals or small capitals. If
small capitals are used the initials of the name are put in full
capitals.

Until within a comparatively short time tables of contents were often
set in small capitals. At the same time it was customary to give a
fairly full synopsis of the contents of each chapter under the chapter
head. The result was a very monotonous page, dull, dense, hard to read.
It is much better and now more common to use small caps for the chapter
heads and ordinary text type for abstracts, using dashes or dots to
separate the phrases in the synopsis and beginning each phrase with a
capital.

The following reproduction of a part of a page from the table of
contents of DeVinne's _Modern Methods of Book Composition_ shows this
method of treatment.

Small capitals are best for subheads when of not more than two lines. If
the subheads are longer it is best to use lower-case.

Signatures and credits are often put in small capitals. It is usually,
however, better to use italics for the purpose. There is no need of a
dash to connect the name with the quotation. When two or more quotations
from the same author are used as mottoes, with reference to the works
from which they are taken or the occasion on which they were said, the
name of the author may be put in small capitals in a separate line, the
name of the book or speech in italics, and the occasion in smaller roman
type.

Numerous signatures to a document or petition, such as the _Mayflower
Compact_ or the _Declaration of Independence_, are often set in columns
using capitals for the initials and small capitals for the rest of the
name. Full capitals are too large for the purpose.

    We therefore, the Commissioners for the Massachusetts, Connecticut,
    and New Haven, do also, for our several governments, subscribe unto
    these.

                            THOMAS GREGSON

Dedications of books are commonly set in small capitals. As these
dedicatory formulas are ordinarily brief there should be wide leading,
good display, and care as to margins. The author will often give very
definite specifications as to the arrangement of his copy in lines, and
this will sometimes cause difficulty, occasionally compelling the use of
too small type. The author's specifications must be followed if he
adheres to them.

Small capitals are much favored for running titles of pages. Full
capitals are much more effective and are to be preferred where the words
are few. Small capitals of 12 or 14 point body are distinct but smaller
sizes are crowded and hard to read. This difficulty can sometimes be
remedied by hair spacing. Over spacing of such lines is objectionable
though it has sometimes prevailed as a temporary fashion.

Small capitals used in running titles are exposed to heavy wear and
their shallow counters are liable to get choked up with ink. Capitals of
the monotint or of a light-faced antique are sometimes selected for
books frequently reprinted where the wear on the exposed running titles
is very severe.

In reprinting letters it is common to use small capitals for the name of
the place from which the letter was written, for the name of the
addressee, and for the signature. In job and advertising work the name
of the month and day and date are generally put in lower-case of the
text letter. This rule is not followed, however, in books. When the
heading of the letter is very long lower-case letters are preferable to
small capitals under the general rules of taste which govern the use of
types. The salutation, _Dear Sir_, _Gentlemen_, or the like, does not
need small capitals. It is better printed in italic lower-case with a
colon (not followed by a dash) at the end. If the matter is double
leaded the salutation may go in a line by itself, otherwise conforming
to the rules just given.

Reprints of formal inscriptions on tablets and the like are often made
in small capitals surrounded by a border. There should be a good relief
of white space between the type and the border.

In the Bible and in hymn books the words LORD and GOD are usually set
with full capital initial and the rest of the word in small capitals.

This is, of course, a method of showing veneration and at one time it
was customary to print all names of spiritual or temporal dignitaries
and magnates or even ordinary names in small capitals. This practice
still lingers in a few newspapers which print the names of persons, even
those of small consequence, in small capitals, especially on the
editorial page.

The tendency is steady toward the discriminating use of capitals, small
capitals, and italics. More and more we restrict the use of marks of
emphasis to the really necessary places leaving the words to tell their
story without outside aid.




SUGGESTIONS AS TO TYPOGRAPHIC USE OF CAPITALS


Capitals are too strong to be used with Arabic numerals. This fault of
proportion is increased by the custom of casting Arabic numerals on an
en body for table work, making them only half as thick as the type. Full
capitals may be used with full figures the width of an ordinary letter.
Condensed capitals may be used with en body numerals.

If old-style capitals and figures are required in the same line use
figures about one-half larger in body than the capitals and justify them
to the line.

It is this difficulty in combining capitals and Arabic numerals in the
same line that causes the extensive use of Roman numerals in chapter
numbers, numbers of other headings, dates on title pages, and the like.

When a large initial three or four lines high is used for the first
letter of a new chapter, large capitals are sometimes used, although
such usage is not free from the reproach of looking too much like
newspaper advertising. When this initial is a two line letter it should
be in alignment with the small capitals of the upper line and the base
line of the text letter of the lower line.

[Illustration:

[Illustration: THERE comes a tide in the affairs of men which,
taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.]

Care should be taken not to compact capitals. Use wider leading and
broader spacing than for lower-case; for example, where you would use
one lead between lower-case lines you should use two or three between
lines of capitals.

Capitals occupy more of the type-body than lower-case letters and
consequently words or lines set entirely with capitals need wider
spacing and leading than the lower-case to make composition readable.
When lines of roman capitals are set solid or single-leaded the en-quad
will usually be enough space between words especially if the words are
short; but for wide-leaded lines and head-lines double spaces (two
three-to-em) will be needed. A head-line of round, open capitals may
even need em-quad spaces. Wide letter words require wide spaces and
words of thin or condensed letters require thin spaces.

Words which begin or end with A Y L V W T may need spaces a little less
than those with H I M, etc. In small types the inequalities in white
space beside or between combinations like L Y A T W and letters with
regular shape like H I M N, may not be readily noticed, but in large
sizes of capitals these differences are greatly increased and will often
make unequal white spaces in a line with uniform metal spaces. In some
styles of types a line may need unequal metal spaces in order to space
the words evenly.

(Marks indicate insertion of spaces.)

[Illustration: TEN MAIL TRAINS]

    This line has en-quads between the words, but the forms
    of L and T make the white space greater than
    between the first and second words.

[Illustration: TEN MAI'L TRAI'N'S]

    This line has an en-quad in first space and three-to-em
    in the second, with hair-spaces between some
    letters of the words.

So, also, it will often be necessary to insert pieces of paper, card, or
thin leads between the letters of a word in large display, in order to
make them evenly spaced, as shown in these examples:

(Marks indicate insertion of spaces.)

This differential spacing in a line of capitals will also be required in
a line having abbreviations or initials. The following line, spaced with
en-quads throughout, has unnecessarily wide spaces between the initials:

[Illustration: JOHN ENDICOTT LODGE, A. O. U. W.]

Spaced with four-to-em in the last three places, it is improved:

[Illustration: JOHN ENDICOTT LODGE, A. O. U. W.]

Capitals used as initials of titles and for other abbreviations, with
the accompanying periods, should be thin-spaced or set close together,
as shown in the second of these examples:

[Illustration:
GEORGE MARKHAM, D. D., PH. D.

JOHN FLINT, M. D. V., BOSTON, U. S. A.

Two or more lines of capitals of the same size should be spaced as
nearly alike as possible. These three lines are so disproportionately
spaced that they are not pleasing:

[Illustration:
NORTH END UNION
B  O  S  T  O  N
MASSACHUSETTS]

The squaring up is arbitrary and strained. The lines are better like
this:

[Illustration:
NORTH END UNION
    BOSTON
MASSACHUSETTS]

But if it is necessary to square up lines and no additional words or
letters can be inserted the short line may be filled with florets or
other characters which should not be bolder than the type itself and
should be of a style to harmonize with it as nearly as possible.

The extra wide spacing of words set in capitals, as in head-lines and
running-heads, should be avoided by the young compositor; there are
places where it may be unobjectionable but it will require good judgment
and some experience to prevent such lines making the page look freakish
or amateurish.

In jobbing, advertisement, and display work, capitals are used more
freely than in plain reading matter. In book work the practice is to use
capitals more freely than in newspaper composition. A study of the
reading columns of daily newspapers will discover that capitals are used
very sparingly and words are "kept down" in many cases which in more
formal book and pamphlet work would be capitalized.

In advertisements, announcements, and circular letters, words are often
capitalized for distinction or emphasis, as in these examples:

    Those who win a Second or First Prize through a monthly or special
    contest become Honor Members of the Guild, and receive the Guild
    badge without charge.

    You are cordially invited to attend the Spring Opening of Suits and
    Outside Garments for Women, on Wednesday and Thursday, April 28 and
    29, in our new Mason Street Annex.

Precise rules for the use of capitals cannot be given for work of all
kinds. Their insertion or omission will be governed greatly by the
subject matter and the style of treatment desired by the proof-reader or
the customer and the compositor's duty will not go further than to
maintain some consistency in their use in each piece of work. When he
has copy in which capitals are used as in the following example he will
be expected either to discard all capitals except at the beginning of
the sentences or to capitalize the words as in the second example:

    Fifty styles of the Smartest and nobbiest wheel specialties for
    ponies and Small horses, Pony carts, light horse novelties, traps,
    wagons, Harness, Saddles, etc.

    Fifty Styles of the Smartest and Nobbiest Wheel Specialties for
    Ponies and Small Horses, Pony Carts, Light Horse Novelties, Traps,
    Wagons, Harness, Saddles, etc.

In lines of large display, like head-lines, set in capitals and
lower-case, all the important words should begin with capitals.
Unimportant words, such as _of_, _the_, _by_, _for_, _but_, _in_, etc.,
except when they are at the beginning of the displayed phrase, are not
capitalized.

    The Best is the Cheapest
    A Great Bargain in Hats

    For Love and Honor

A line of capitals containing an abbreviation or other short word should
have capitals throughout when possible, as in the second form of these
examples:

    JOHN SMITH, Jr.              JOHN SMITH, JR.
    ROBINSON & Co.               ROBINSON & CO.

In advertisement display lines like the following are permissible:

    The GOLDEN HARVESTER
    REGAL SHOES _for_ MEN

Combinations of different sizes and styles of types are also common and
serve their purpose properly, as in this style, often used in billheads,
etc.

    TO THOMAS W. ABBOTT, DR.
    _In account with_ FRANK ABBOTT

Combinations of large and small capitals and lower-case like the
following are, however, not approved:

    WILLIAM BROWN, President

The words in small capitals as well as the word in lower-case should
begin with large capitals, like this:

    WILLIAM BROWN, President

When lines of capitals are used in books and pamphlets, for headings and
display, they should be used consistently--that is, all headings of a
similar kind should be alike in any piece of work, and not one heading
in capitals and another in lower-case. The composition of a title page
is more pleasing when its chief lines are in one style of letters,
giving a harmonious effect. When lines of capitals and lines of
lower-case are interspersed in a page an appearance of confusion is
liable to be the result.

QUESTIONS


As the subject matter of this book is such that many of the questions
will serve only to bring out the accuracy of the pupil's memory of rules
it is very desirable that care should be taken to insure intelligent use
and application of the rules. To be able to repeat a rule is of very
little importance compared with the ability to apply it intelligently.

The instructor should give the pupils constant practice in the
application of these rules. This should consist of;--

(a) Study of passages taken from all kinds of printed matter.

(b) Rewriting of passages given out without capitalization.

In the first case a wide range of material should be used from the most
carefully printed books to the most carelessly printed matter that can
be found, including newspapers of varying excellence and pure
advertising matter. The capitalization found should be studied and
explained by the rules and the criticisms or changes suggested justified
in the same way.

In like manner in the second case every capital used in the rewritten
text should be justified by the proper rule.

Without such exercises as these, the book will have comparatively little
value.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT


This series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the splendid
co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals engaged in the
printing business and its allied industries in the United States of
America.

The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America, under whose
auspices the books have been prepared and published, acknowledges its
indebtedness for the generous assistance rendered by the many authors,
printers, and others identified with this work.

While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright pages of those
contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless felt that a group
list of co-operating firms would be of interest.

The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who have
co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes, constituting the
first printing. As soon as the entire list of books comprising the
Typographic Technical Series has been completed (which the Committee hopes
will be at an early date), the full list will be printed in each volume.

The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to the many
subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its publication.
