<h2><a name="CAPITALS" id="CAPITALS"></a>CAPITALS</h2>


<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>A capital letter is a letter of formal shape. Capitals
were originally derived from the stiff and angular letters
used in formal inscriptions. Originally all writing was
done in capitals. Later the scribes devised less formal shapes
for the letters, making use of lines more easily made by brush
or pen on papyrus, parchment, or paper. The capitals were
retained for certain uses but the less formal shapes were
employed to do the greater part of the work. These less
formal letters have been known by several names. They
will be referred to here by that under which they are known
to modern printers, &#8220;lower-case.&#8221;</p>

<p>A further modification of the letter came with the introduction
of the sloping, or italic letter. This received its
name from its place of origin, Italy. It was introduced by
Nicholas Jenson, a printer of Venice, and was an imitation
of the handwriting of the Italian poet Petrarch. Originally
it was used only for the lower-case and was combined with
the older form of capital letters, called roman, also from
the place of its origin. Later the italic characteristics
were given to capitals as well as lower-case letters.</p>

<p>An ordinary font of book type contains five series of letters:
full capitals, small capitals, italic capitals (full size),
roman lower-case, and italic lower-case. The full capital,
roman or italic, is larger than the other letters of the font,
every letter being as high as the lower-case ascenders. The
small capital is only as high as the lower-case round letters.
Larger capitals still are sometimes used as chapter initials
and the like.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the distinction between capital
and lower-case letters is one of form, not of size. The full
capitals being much more used than the small capitals and
being larger than the other letters in the font, the impression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
is common that the size is the distinguishing mark.
This erroneous impression has even crept into dictionary
definitions.</p>

<p>The full capital, which will hereafter be called in this book
simply the capital, is used in combination with lower-case
letters or with small capitals in the same word. The small
capital is not used in combination with lower-case in the
same word. We may print GEORGE WASHINGTON,
<span class="smcap">George Washington</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GEORGE WASHINGTON</span>, or George
Washington, but not <span class="smcap">g</span>eorge <span class="smcap">w</span>ashington.</p>

<p>In manuscript capitals are indicated by three lines under
a word or letter, <img src="images/iltriple.gif" width="30" height="15" alt="triple line" title="triple line" />
 and small capitals by two lines <img src="images/ildouble.gif" width="30" height="15" alt="double line" title="double line" />.
A single line <img src="images/ilsingle.gif" width="30" height="15" alt="single line" title="single line" /> indicates that italics are to
be used.</p>

<p>Originally the writers of manuscripts used capitals for
ornament and variety in the text. They followed no rules
but each writer was guided by his own judgment and sense
of beauty. As the use of capitals gradually became systematized
and reduced to rules, different systems were adopted
in different countries. The use of capitals varies greatly in
different languages. Attention will be mainly confined in
this book to the usages followed in the printing of English.
Attempts to point out the various differences to be found
in German, French, etc. would only confuse the young
apprentice.</p>

<p>These rules grow out of a fundamental principle.</p>

<p>The purpose of capitals is to emphasize the words in
which they are employed. With the exception of the cases
of the words <i>I</i> and <i>O</i>, which are capitalized for typographical
reasons, this idea of calling special attention to a word,
or words, for one reason or another will be found to be at
the bottom of the variations in usage in different printing
offices and by different writers. The same tendency is
observable here which is so evident in style and in punctuation.
Direct statements, simple sentences as free from involution
and complication as possible, are more and more
taking the place of the involved, complicated, and obscure
sentences of old times. The ideal style of to-day consists
of simple words simply arranged. Such a style needs little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
pointing. The reader is quite able to find his way through
the paragraph without constant direction. Punctuation
marks are directions at the crossroads of thought. Consequently
the punctuation mark is now much more sparingly
used than formerly.</p>

<p>Just as we have found out that well chosen words can
tell their story with very few marks of interpretation so we
have found out that they can tell their story with very few
marks of emphasis. The use of capitals has decreased
greatly during the last two centuries and is constantly
decreasing, and this tendency is likely to go still further.
The great DeVinne whose books on <i>The Practice of
Typography</i>, written ten to fifteen years ago, are still of the
highest authority was thoroughly up-to-date in his methods
and was remarkable for the restrained and refined good
taste which characterized all his recommendations, but in
some points restraint in the use of capitals has gone even
beyond his precepts.</p>

<p>It is worth while to remember that the real implement
of English speech is the word, not the point nor the letter
form. Just to the extent that we rely on marks of punctuation
and emphasis to convey our meaning we betray our
ignorance of the really significant elements of the language.
The schoolgirl says she &#8220;had a <i>perfectly splendid</i> time&#8221; at
the dance, when she tells about it in her letter to her dearest
friend. If &#8220;perfectly splendid&#8221; were a proper term to
use in such a connection, which it is not, the words themselves
would carry all the emphasis possible. Nothing could
really be added to them by any typographical device. In
the same way the common use of profanity among ignorant
people probably arises mainly from a feeling that the
ordinary words with which they are familiar are colorless
and do not express their thoughts with sufficient emphasis.</p>

<p>Just as emphasis in style is difficult when one habitually
uses the strongest words and emphasis in voice is difficult
when one habitually shouts, so emphasis in print is difficult
when one habitually uses large capitals, display type, and
italics. Loud printing is as objectionable as loud talking.</p>

<h2><a name="USE_OF_FULL_CAPITALS" id="USE_OF_FULL_CAPITALS"></a>USE OF FULL CAPITALS</h2>


<p>General uses:</p>

<p>1. Use a capital letter to begin every sentence and every
word or group of words punctuated as a sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Welcome! We are glad to see you.</i></p></div>

<p>This rule does not apply to literal reproductions of
matter not originally conforming to it.</p>

<p>2. Use a capital letter to begin every line of poetry.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The Lord hates a quitter,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But he doesn&rsquo;t hate him, son,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>When the quitter&rsquo;s quitting something</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He shouldn&rsquo;t have begun. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [that</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This rule does not apply to turned over lines like the
third line in the stanza just preceding.</p>

<p>3. Use a capital letter to begin every quotation consisting
of a complete sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Ben Franklin says, &#8220;Honesty is the best policy.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>The campaign was &#8220;a punitive expedition for the
suppression of brigandage.&#8221;</i></p></div>


<p>Capitalize:</p>

<p>1. Names of the Deity, of the members of the Trinity, of
the Virgin Mary, and of the Devil, when a personal
devil is referred to.</p>

<p>When the word devil is used as a general term or as
an expletive the capital is not used.</p>

<p>2. Nouns and adjectives used to designate the Deity or
any member of the Trinity:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>the Almighty</i>, <i>the Ruler of the Universe</i>, <i>the Supreme
Architect of the Universe</i>, <i>the Creator</i>,
<i>Providence</i> (personified), <i>Heaven</i> (personified,
e. g., <i>Heaven forbid!</i>), <i>Father</i>, <i>Son</i>, <i>Holy Ghost</i>,
<i>Spirit</i>, <i>Messiah</i>, and the like.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>The following list of words of this sort to be capitalized,
taken from Mr. William Dana Orcutt&rsquo;s <i>The Writer&rsquo;s Desk
Book</i> (Frederick A. Stokes, New York) will be found
useful:</p>


<p class="blockquot">
Almighty<br />
Authorized Version<br />
Common Version<br />
Creator<br />
Deity<br />
Father<br />
God<br />
Holy Bible<br />
Holy Spirit<br />
Holy Writ<br />
Jehovah<br />
Jesus Christ<br />
King<br />
Logos<br />
Lord<br />
Messiah<br />
Passover<br />
Pentecost<br />
Redeemer<br />
Revised Version<br />
Sabbath<br />
Saviour<br />
Scriptures<br />
Son of Man<br />
Son<br />
Spirit<br />
The Trinity<br />
The Virgin Mary<br />
Word<br />
</p>

<p>Care needs to be taken with words of this class. Particular
attention should be paid to the wording of rule 2, just
given. The same words in other senses or other connections
are not capitalized. <i>Heaven</i> and <i>hell</i> and derived adjectives
are not capitalized in their ordinary uses:</p>

<p>Adjectives and other derivatives from these words are
not capitalized. We write <i>Messiah</i>, but <i>messianic</i> and
<i>messiahship</i>; <i>Christology</i> but <i>christological</i>, <i>fatherhood</i>, <i>sonship</i>,
and the like.</p>

<p>Such words as <i>deity</i>, <i>god</i>, and the like are not capitalized
where any but the God of the Bible is referred to.</p>

<p>3. Pronouns referring to God, Christ, or the Holy Spirit
in direct address or where there might otherwise be
ambiguity.</p>

<p>These pronouns are not capitalized in the Bible. They
are generally capitalized in hymn books and books of devotion.
These pronouns were formerly all capitalized as a
mark of respect to God whenever there was any mention
of him, even indirect. The tendency is more and more to
eliminate them except in the second person (direct address).
In view of the change now going on it is best to
follow copy if the author appears to have decided preferences.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>4. Books, divisions, and versions of the Bible.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>Book of Job</i>, <i>Twenty-third Psalm</i>,<br />
<i>New Testament</i>, <i>Revised Version</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>5. General biblical terms and titles of parables.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Law</i>, <i>The Prophets</i>, <i>Major and Minor
Prophets</i> (referring to the collections of prophetic
books), <i>Lord&rsquo;s Prayer</i>, <i>Lord&rsquo;s Supper</i>,
<i>Parable of the Prodigal Son</i>, <i>the Beatitudes</i>, <i>the
Priestly Code</i> and many other such terms.</p></div>

<p>Use lower-case for <i>biblical</i> and <i>scriptural</i>.</p>

<p>6. Capitalize <i>Holy</i> in <i>Holy place</i> and <i>Holy of holies</i>.</p>

<p>Say <i>Gospel of John</i>, but speak of the <i>gospel message</i>.</p>

<p>7. The names of religious bodies and their followers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Catholic</i>, <i>Protestant</i>, <i>Unitarian</i>, <i>Methodist</i>,
<i>Buddhists</i>, <i>Taoists</i>, <i>Lamas</i>.</p></div>

<p>8. The names of monastic orders and their followers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jesuits</i>, <i>Brothers of the Common Life</i>,
<i>Recollets</i>, <i>Crutched Friars</i>, <i>Cowley Fathers</i>.</p></div>

<p>9. The word Church when it stands for the Church
universal or is a part of the name of some particular
denomination or organization.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>For salvation he sought the Church.</i><br />
<i>The Church of Rome.</i><br />
<i>The First Presbyterian Church.</i><br />
<i>I was on my way to church.</i><br />
<i>He is a student of church history.</i> (Note use of lower-case in this sentence.)<br />
</p>

<p>10. The names of creeds and professions of faith.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Apostle&rsquo;s Creed</i>, <i>Thirty-nine
Articles</i>, <i>Nicene Creed</i>.</p></div>

<p>Note that the adjective ante-Nicene is printed as it here
appears.</p>

<p>11. The word &#8220;father&#8221; when used in direct reference to
the fathers of the church, and to the Pilgrim leaders
of New England, and the word &#8220;reformers&#8221; when
used of the leaders of the Reformation.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>The ante-Nicene Fathers.</i><br />
<i>Luther, Calvin and the other Reformers.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
The word &#8220;father&#8221; is not capitalized when the reference
is general, as in the first sentence of this section.</p>

<p>The capitalization of &#8220;reformer&#8221; is intended to distinguish
persons connected with a certain definite historical
movement from persons interested in reform. Many persons
might consider that the Reformers were not reformers.</p>

<p>12. Names of persons.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>John Smith,</i><br />
<i>George V.</i><br />
</p>

<p>But write <i>John o&rsquo; Groat</i>, <i>Tam o&rsquo; Shanter</i>, and the like
where <i>o&rsquo;</i> is an abbreviation of <i>of</i> and not the G&aelig;lic <i>O&rsquo;</i> as
<i>O&rsquo;Neil</i>, etc.</p>

<p>In writing foreign names which contain particles, capitalize
the particles when not preceded by a Christian name
or title.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>Alfred de Musset</i> but <i>De Musset</i>,<br />
<i>le Due de Morny</i> but <i>De Morny</i>,<br />
<i>Prince von Bismarck</i> but <i>Von Bismarck</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>By exception the Dutch particle &#8220;van&#8221; is always
capitalized.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Van Hoorn</i>, <i>Stephen Van Renssel&aelig;r</i>.</p></div>

<p>13. Epithets appended to proper names or substituted for
them.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>Frederick the Great</i><br />
<i>Peter the Hermit</i><br />
<i>William Red Head (Rufus)</i><br />
<i>the Conqueror</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>14. Names of races of men.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Aryan</i>, <i>Caucasian</i>, etc., but generally <i>negro</i> and
<i>gypsy</i>, by exception.</p></div>

<p>15. Names of places.</p>

<p>a. Cities, rivers, oceans, lakes, mountains, etc.</p>


<p class="blockquot">
<i>Chicago</i><br />
<i>Mississippi River</i><br />
<i>Atlantic Ocean</i><br />
<i>Lake Superior</i><br />
<i>Pike&rsquo;s Peak</i><br />
<i>Strawberry Hill</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Note that the generic terms ocean, lake, mountain and
the like are capitalized only when they are an actual part
of the name itself. We would say &#8220;<i>The Atlantic Ocean lies
east of the United States</i>,&#8221; but we would say &#8220;<i>The states
which form the North American republic look out on two great
oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The following tables are taken from <i>A Manual for
Writers</i> by John Matthews Manley and John Arthur Powell
(University of Chicago Press, Chicago).</p>

<p>Subject to the rule just stated, they will be found very
useful.</p>

<p>Capitalize, in singular form only, when immediately
following the name</p>


<p class="blockquot">
Archipelago<br />
Borough<br />
Branch (stream)<br />
Butte<br />
Canyon<br />
County<br />
Crater<br />
Creek<br />
Delta<br />
Forest<br />
Fork<br />
Gap<br />
Glacier<br />
Gulch<br />
Harbor<br />
Head<br />
Hollow<br />
Mesa<br />
Narrows<br />
Ocean<br />
Parish (La.)<br />
Park<br />
Plateau<br />
Range<br />
Reservation<br />
Ridge<br />
River<br />
Run<br />
</p>

<p>Capitalize in singular or plural form when immediately
following the name</p>


<p class="blockquot">
Hill<br />
Island<br />
Mountain<br />
Spring<br />
</p>

<p>Capitalize, in singular form, either before or after the
name; and in plural form before the name</p>


<p class="blockquot">
Bay<br />
Bayou<br />
Camp (military)<br />
Cape<br />
Dalles<br />
Desert<br />
Falls<br />
Fort<br />
Isle<br />
Lake<br />
Mount<br />
Oasis<br />
Pass<br />
Peak<br />
Point<br />
Port<br />
Sea<br />
Strait<br />
Valley<br />
Volcano<br />
</p>

<p>b. Names of streets, squares, parks, buildings, etc.</p>


<p class="blockquot">
<i>Amsterdam Avenue</i><br />
<i>Van Buren Street</i><br />
<i>Independence Square</i><br />
<i>Lincoln Park</i><br />
<i>Transportation Building</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
The same rule as to capitalization of the generic name
holds here as in the preceding section. The usual tendency
to drop capitals is at work here and newspapers now write
<i>Washington street</i> and <i>Federal building</i>. It is very probable
that the capitals will finally be dropped from the generic
terms wherever used.</p>

<p>Printers should keep a careful watch on the usage of the
best offices so as to keep advised as to the progress of these
changes.</p>

<p>c. Nouns, and adjectives derived from them designating
recognized geographical divisions of a country or of the
world.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>East</i>, <i>West</i>, <i>North</i>, <i>South</i>,<br />
<i>Westerner</i>, <i>Oriental</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>When these words are used in their ordinary significance
of mere direction or location they are not capitalized
except that in writing of Biblical history we speak of the
<i>Northern Kingdom</i> and the <i>Southern Kingdom</i> into which
Solomon&rsquo;s territory was split after his death.</p>

<p>16. Generic terms for political divisions.</p>

<p>a. When the term is part of the name and directly
follows it.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>Holy Roman Empire</i><br />
<i>British Empire</i><br />
<i>Northwest Territory</i><br />
<i>Queen&rsquo;s County</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>b. When it is used with the preposition of in such
phrases as <i>Borough of the Bronx</i>, <i>Department of the Gulf</i>.</p>

<p>c. When part of a nickname, <i>The Crescent City</i>, <i>the
Buckeye State</i>, <i>the City of Brotherly Love</i>.</p>

<p>Be careful not to capitalize such words when they are
not an actual part of the name. <i>French Republic</i> is the name
of the county, exactly translating <i>Republique Francaise</i>, but
<i>American republic</i> is not such a name. You would write
<i>State of New York</i> in a legal document in which the state
would be considered as a corporate person, but in ordinary
references it would be <i>state of New York</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
17. The days of the week and the months of the year, but
not the seasons unless personified.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>Monday the fifth of August.</i><br />
<i>April is the first month of spring.</i><br />
<i>Spring, beautiful Spring.</i><br />
</p>

<p>But write <i>ten o&rsquo;clock</i>, <i>nine a.m.</i>, <i>ten p.m.</i></p>

<p>18. Festivals and historic or famous days.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>Easter Day</i><br />
<i>Fast Day</i><br />
<i>Independence Day</i><br />
<i>Black Friday</i>.<br />
</p>

</p>

<p>33. In foreign languages the usage is somewhat different.
The following rules will be found useful:</p>

<p>a. Always capitalize the first word.</p>

<p>b. In Latin capitalize only proper nouns and adjectives
derived therefrom.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Commentarii C&aelig;saris de bello Gallico.</i></p></div>

<p>c. In French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and Norwegian,
capitalize proper names but not adjectives derived therefrom.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>La vie de Ronsard</i>; <i>Histoire de la litterature
francaise</i>, <i>Novelle e racconti popolari italiani</i>,
<i>Antologia de poetas liricos castellanos</i>.</p></div>

<p>d. In German capitalize all nouns and all adjectives derived
from the names of persons but not those derived
from other proper nouns.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>Geschichte des deutsches Reich</i><br />
<i>Die Homerische Frage</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>e. In Danish capitalize all nouns.</p>

<p>f. In Dutch capitalize all nouns and all adjectives derived
from proper nouns.</p>

<p>34. Titles of ancient manuscripts.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Codex Alexandrinus.</i></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
35. In titles of books, etc. all nouns forming parts of
hyphenated compounds should be capitalized.</p>

<p>36. In side heads capitalize the first word and proper
nouns only.</p>

<p>37. Personal titles as follows:</p>

<p>a. Titles preceding a name and so forming part of it.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>King George V.</i><br />
<i>Pope Benedict XV.</i><br />
<i>Duke William of Aquitaine.</i><br />
</p>

<p>But not otherwise.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Woodrow Wilson</i>, <i>president of the United States</i>,
<i>the emperor of Germany</i>, <i>the present king of Spain
is Alfonso XIII</i>.</p></div>

<p>b. Titles used in place of the name with reference to a
particular person or to the present holder of an
office.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>I hope when in Rome to see the Pope.</i><br />
<i>He hoped some day to become pope.</i><br />
</p>

<p>c. Familiar names applied to a particular person.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>the Father of his Country.</i><br />
<i>Unser Fritz.</i><br />
<i>the Little Corporal.</i><br />
</p>

<p>d. Orders of knighthood and titles attached to them.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>Knight of the Garter</i>,<br />
<i>Knight Commander of St. Michael and St. George</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>e. Titles used in direct address.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Good morning, Mr. President.</i></p></div>

<p>f. Academic degrees in abbreviated form following a
name.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>David Starr Jordan, Ph. D., LL.&nbsp;D.</i></p>

<p>So also letters following a name indicating membership
of certain scientific and artistic organizations.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>F.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;S.</i> (Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society).<br />
<i>R.&nbsp;A.</i> (Member of the Royal Academy).<br />
</p>

<p>So also in the United States and Great Britain, <i>M.&nbsp;C.</i>
(Member of Congress) and <i>M.&nbsp;P.</i> (Member of
Parliament).</p>

<p>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Where a person has many titles the following of this rule
involves certain difficulties. Such a name as</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>John Smith, A.&nbsp;M., D.&nbsp;D., Ph. D., L.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;D.,
D.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;L., LL.&nbsp;D.</i> is by no means impossible.</p></div>

<p>In such a case the titles become much more prominent
than the name and the page is disfigured by the spotty
appearance of the text. Small capitals may sometimes
be used with good effect in such a case but this should
not be done without obtaining proper permission.</p>

<p>The difficulty of handling these long and numerous
titles in the composition of title pages is sometimes
considerable. Three methods of dealing with the
difficulty are open.</p>

<p>a. The honorary titles may be put in capitals regardless
of the unsightly appearance of the line.</p>

<p>b. The honorary titles may be put in a small size of the
same face and justified in the line. This lessens the
undue prominence of the titles, but puts the line out
of balance.</p>

<p>c. The honorary titles may be put in a separate line, or
lines, below the name, set in small type, and spelled
out in full. It is not necessary to capitalize <i>jr.</i> and
<i>sr.</i> in lower-case text matter unless so desired by the
author.</p>

<p>In compound titles capitalize each word if it would
be capitalized separately.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>Major General Leonard Wood</i>,<br />
<i>Chief Justice Taney</i>,<br />
<i>Commander-in-Chief Field</i><br />
<i>Marshal Sir John French</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>38. Names of things personified.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Nature</i>, <i>Vice</i>, <i>Thrift</i>, and the like.</p></div>

<p>39. Adjectives derived from proper nouns.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>The Elizabethan age.</i><br />
<i>Roman law.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Such adjectives and even proper nouns themselves lose
the capital when they are applied as trade or scientific names
to articles of common use or reference.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>roman type</i>, <i>india ink</i>, <i>chinese white</i>, <i>volt</i>, <i>watt</i>,
<i>boycott</i>, <i>platonic</i>, <i>bohemian</i>.</p></div>

<p>40. The first word of a direct quotation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>As he turned to go he said: &#8220;Farewell, we shall
never meet again.&#8221;</i></p></div>

<p>41. The first word after &#8220;Whereas&#8221; and &#8220;Resolved&#8221;
in resolutions.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>WHEREAS. It has pleased God....</i><br />
<i>therefore be it<br />
RESOLVED, That....</i><br />
</p>

<p>42. The first word after a colon when the colon introduces
a logically complete phrase not very closely connected
with what precedes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>My conclusion is: A policy of consistent neutrality
is the only proper one for the country.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>As the proverb well says: Beware the anger of a
patient man.</i></p></div>

<p>43. <i>O</i> interjection, but not <i>oh</i> unless it begins a sentence.</p>

<p>In Latin sentences of exclamation, denunciation or appeal
the lower-case <i>o</i> is used.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>O tempora, o mores temporum.</i></p></div>

<p>44. The first personal pronoun <i>I</i> wherever it occurs.</p>

<p>45. Emphasized words.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>We stand for Liberty and Union.</i></p></div>

<p>This use should be avoided except for advertising display,
or job work.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>We call attention to our Stock of
Boots, Shoes, and Furnishings.</i></p></div>

<h2><a name="SMALL_CAPITALS" id="SMALL_CAPITALS"></a>SMALL CAPITALS</h2>


<p>The use of small capitals presents its own peculiar problems
to the printer. The small capital has the form of
the large capital but without its size and conspicuousness.
The small capitals are ordinarily no taller than the round
letters of the lower-case. They are usually on a smaller set,
with a lighter face and obscured by more connecting lines.
In many fonts of type they are really the weakest and least
distinguished of all the five series. Wide enough to cover
the body of the type fairly thoroughly in most letters and
thus to reduce the apparent space between letters, without
ascenders and without descenders, they are very monotonous
and singularly ineffective when used in any considerable
quantity. When used in masses it is at times even
difficult to read them.</p>

<p>The use of small capitals is quite different from that
of large ones. For the reasons just given they are not
suited to display. For this purpose they are no better
than italics, if as good. Owing to their lack of striking
appearance and commanding quality they are not used for
emphasis. Display and emphasis it will be remembered
are the two principal uses of the full capital.</p>

<p>Small capitals are used more for variety than for display.
They are commonly used for:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Side heads</p>

<p>Running titles</p>

<p>Catch lines of title pages when
particular display is not desired.</p></div>

<p>They are sometimes used for the first word after a blank
line, especially for the first word of a new chapter.</p>

<p>Long quotations of poetry are often printed with the first
word in small capitals. In this, as in the preceding case,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the whole word is printed in small capitals except the first
letter which is a full capital.</p>

<p>Proper names standing at the beginning of a chapter,
occasionally even of a paragraph, are sometimes spelled in
capitals or small capitals. If small capitals are used the
initials of the name are put in full capitals.</p>

<p>Until within a comparatively short time tables of contents
were often set in small capitals. At the same time
it was customary to give a fairly full synopsis of the contents
of each chapter under the chapter head. The result
was a very monotonous page, dull, dense, hard to read.
It is much better and now more common to use small caps
for the chapter heads and ordinary text type for abstracts,
using dashes or dots to separate the phrases in the synopsis
and beginning each phrase with a capital.</p>

<p>The following reproduction of a part of a page from the
table of contents of DeVinne&rsquo;s <i>Modern Methods of Book

Small capitals are best for subheads when of not more
than two lines. If the subheads are longer it is best to use
lower-case.</p>

<p>Signatures and credits are often put in small capitals.
It is usually, however, better to use italics for the purpose.
There is no need of a dash to connect the name with the
quotation. When two or more quotations from the same
author are used as mottoes, with reference to the works
from which they are taken or the occasion on which they
were said, the name of the author may be put in small
capitals in a separate line, the name of the book or speech
in italics, and the occasion in smaller roman type.</p>

<p>Numerous signatures to a document or petition, such as
the <i>Mayflower Compact</i> or the <i>Declaration of Independence</i>, are
often set in columns using capitals for the initials and small
capitals for the rest of the name. Full capitals are too
large for the purpose.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We therefore, the Commissioners for the Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and New Haven, do also, for
our several governments, subscribe unto these.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">John Winthrop</span>, Governor of the Massachusetts<br />
<span class="smcap">Thomas Dudley</span> <span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Theophilus Eaton</span><br />
<span class="smcap">George Fenwick</span><span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 2.7em;">Edward Hopkins</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.7em;"><span class="smcap">Thomas Gregson</span></span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Dedications of books are commonly set in small capitals.
As these dedicatory formulas are ordinarily brief there
should be wide leading, good display, and care as to margins.
The author will often give very definite specifications
as to the arrangement of his copy in lines, and this will
sometimes cause difficulty, occasionally compelling the use
of too small type. The author&rsquo;s specifications must be
followed if he adheres to them.</p>

<p>Small capitals are much favored for running titles of pages.
Full capitals are much more effective and are to be preferred
where the words are few. Small capitals of 12 or 14 point
body are distinct but smaller sizes are crowded and hard to
read. This difficulty can sometimes be remedied by hair
spacing. Over spacing of such lines is objectionable though
it has sometimes prevailed as a temporary fashion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Small capitals used in running titles are exposed to heavy
wear and their shallow counters are liable to get choked up
with ink. Capitals of the monotint or of a light-faced
antique are sometimes selected for books frequently reprinted
where the wear on the exposed running titles is
very severe.</p>

<p>In reprinting letters it is common to use small capitals
for the name of the place from which the letter was written,
for the name of the addressee, and for the signature. In
job and advertising work the name of the month and day
and date are generally put in lower-case of the text letter.
This rule is not followed, however, in books. When the
heading of the letter is very long lower-case letters are preferable
to small capitals under the general rules of taste
which govern the use of types. The salutation, <i>Dear Sir</i>,
<i>Gentlemen</i>, or the like, does not need small capitals. It is
better printed in italic lower-case with a colon (not followed
by a dash) at the end. If the matter is double leaded the
salutation may go in a line by itself, otherwise conforming
to the rules just given.</p>

<p>Reprints of formal inscriptions on tablets and the like
are often made in small capitals surrounded by a border.
There should be a good relief of white space between the
type and the border.</p>

<p>In the Bible and in hymn books the words <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and
<span class="smcap">God</span> are usually set with full capital initial and the rest of
the word in small capitals.</p>

<p>This is, of course, a method of showing veneration and
at one time it was customary to print all names of spiritual
or temporal dignitaries and magnates or even ordinary
names in small capitals. This practice still lingers in a few
newspapers which print the names of persons, even those
of small consequence, in small capitals, especially on the
editorial page.</p>

<p>The tendency is steady toward the discriminating use of
capitals, small capitals, and italics. More and more we restrict
the use of marks of emphasis to the really necessary
places leaving the words to tell their story without outside
aid.</p>

<h2><a name="SUGGESTIONS_AS_TO_TYPOGRAPHIC" id="SUGGESTIONS_AS_TO_TYPOGRAPHIC"></a>SUGGESTIONS AS TO TYPOGRAPHIC
USE OF CAPITALS</h2>


<p>Capitals are too strong to be used with Arabic numerals.
This fault of proportion is increased by the
custom of casting Arabic numerals on an en body for table
work, making them only half as thick as the type. Full capitals
may be used with full figures the width of an ordinary letter.
Condensed capitals may be used with en body numerals.</p>

<p>If old-style capitals and figures are required in the same
line use figures about one-half larger in body than the capitals
and justify them to the line.</p>

<p>It is this difficulty in combining capitals and Arabic numerals
in the same line that causes the extensive use of
Roman numerals in chapter numbers, numbers of other
headings, dates on title pages, and the like.</p>

<p>When a large initial three or four lines high is used for
the first letter of a new chapter, large capitals are sometimes
used, although such usage is not free from the reproach of
looking too much like newspaper advertising. When this
initial is a two line letter it should be in alignment with
the small capitals of the upper line and the base line of the
text letter of the lower line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 571px;">
<img src="images/il001.png" width="571" height="164" alt="Large initial capital examples" title="Large initial capital examples" />
</div>

<p>Care should be taken not to compact capitals. Use wider
leading and broader spacing than for lower-case; for example,
where you would use one lead between lower-case
lines you should use two or three between lines of capitals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Capitals occupy more of the type-body than lower-case
letters and consequently words or lines set entirely with
capitals need wider spacing and leading than the lower-case
to make composition readable. When lines of roman capitals
are set solid or single-leaded the en-quad will usually
be enough space between words especially if the words are
short; but for wide-leaded lines and head-lines double
spaces (two three-to-em) will be needed. A head-line of
round, open capitals may even need em-quad spaces. Wide
letter words require wide spaces and words of thin or condensed
letters require thin spaces.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 592px;">
<img src="images/il002.png" width="592" height="220" alt="Spacing when using capitals examples" title="Spacing when using capitals examples" />
</div>

<p>Words which begin or end with A Y L V W T may
need spaces a little less than those with H I M, etc. In
small types the inequalities in white space beside or between
combinations like L Y A T W and letters with
regular shape like H I M N, may not be readily noticed,
but in large sizes of capitals these differences are greatly
increased and will often make unequal white spaces in a
line with uniform metal spaces. In some styles of types
a line may need unequal metal spaces in order to space the
words evenly.</p>

<p class="center">(Marks indicate insertion of spaces.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 572px;">
<img src="images/il003.png" width="572" height="62" alt="TEN MAIL TRAINS" title="TEN MAIL TRAINS" />
</div>

<p class="center">
This line has en-quads between the words, but the forms<br />
of L and T make the white space greater than<br />
between the first and second words.<br />
</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;">
<img src="images/il004.png" width="590" height="75" alt="TEN MAI&#39;L TRAI&#39;N&#39;S" title="TEN MAI&#39;L TRAI&#39;N&#39;S" />
</div>

<p class="center">
This line has an en-quad in first space and three-to-em<br />
in the second, with hair-spaces between some<br />
letters of the words.<br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
So, also, it will often be necessary to insert pieces of
paper, card, or thin leads between the letters of a word
in large display, in order to make them evenly spaced, as
shown in these examples:</p>

<p class="center">(Marks indicate insertion of spaces.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 562px;">
<img src="images/il005.png" width="562" height="330" alt="PLAINLY EVENLY and UNEVELY SPACED" title="PLAINLY EVENLY and UNEVELY SPACED" />
</div>

<p>This differential spacing in a line of capitals will also be
required in a line having abbreviations or initials. The following
line, spaced with en-quads throughout, has unnecessarily
wide spaces between the initials:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 581px;">
<img src="images/il006.png" width="582" height="38" alt="Spacing abbreviations and initials example" title="Spacing abbreviations and initials example" />
</div>

<p>Spaced with four-to-em in the last three places, it is
improved:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 581px;">
<img style="left: 0;" src="images/il007.png" width="567" height="36" alt="Spacing abbreviations and initials example" title="Spacing abbreviations and initials example" />
</div>

<p>Capitals used as initials of titles and for other abbreviations,
with the accompanying periods, should be thin-spaced
or set close together, as shown in the second of
these examples:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/il008.png" width="600" height="161" alt="Spacing example" title="Spacing example" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Two or more lines of capitals of the same size should
be spaced as nearly alike as possible. These three lines are
so disproportionately spaced that they are not pleasing:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">
<img src="images/il009.png" width="419" height="145" alt="Spacing example" title="Spacing example" />
</div>

<p>The squaring up is arbitrary and strained. The lines are
better like this:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;">
<img src="images/il010.png" width="426" height="152" alt="Spacing example" title="Spacing example" />
</div>

<p>But if it is necessary to square up lines and no additional
words or letters can be inserted the short line may be filled
with florets or other characters which should not be bolder
than the type itself and should be of a style to harmonize
with it as nearly as possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">
<img src="images/il011.png" width="423" height="148" alt="Spacing example" title="Spacing example" />
</div>

<p>The extra wide spacing of words set in capitals, as in
head-lines and running-heads, should be avoided by the
young compositor; there are places where it may be unobjectionable
but it will require good judgment and some
experience to prevent such lines making the page look
freakish or amateurish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
In jobbing, advertisement, and display work, capitals are
used more freely than in plain reading matter. In book
work the practice is to use capitals more freely than in
newspaper composition. A study of the reading columns
of daily newspapers will discover that capitals are used very
sparingly and words are &#8220;kept down&#8221; in many cases which
in more formal book and pamphlet work would be capitalized.</p>

<p>In advertisements, announcements, and circular letters,
words are often capitalized for distinction or emphasis, as
in these examples:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Those who win a Second or First Prize
through a monthly or special contest become
Honor Members of the Guild, and
receive the Guild badge without charge.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You are cordially invited to attend the
Spring Opening of Suits and Outside
Garments for Women, on Wednesday
and Thursday, April 28 and 29, in our
new Mason Street Annex.</p></div>

<p>Precise rules for the use of capitals cannot be given for
work of all kinds. Their insertion or omission will be
governed greatly by the subject matter and the style of
treatment desired by the proof-reader or the customer and
the compositor&rsquo;s duty will not go further than to maintain
some consistency in their use in each piece of work. When
he has copy in which capitals are used as in the following
example he will be expected either to discard all capitals
except at the beginning of the sentences or to capitalize
the words as in the second example:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Fifty styles of the Smartest and nobbiest
wheel specialties for ponies and Small
horses, Pony carts, light horse novelties,
traps, wagons, Harness, Saddles, etc.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Fifty Styles of the Smartest and Nobbiest
Wheel Specialties for Ponies and Small
Horses, Pony Carts, Light Horse Novelties,
Traps, Wagons, Harness, Saddles,
etc.</p></div>

<p>In lines of large display, like head-lines, set in capitals
and lower-case, all the important words should begin with
capitals. Unimportant words, such as <i>of</i>, <i>the</i>, <i>by</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>but</i>,
<i>in</i>, etc., except when they are at the beginning of the displayed
phrase, are not capitalized.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="font-size: larger;">
Notice to the Public<br />
The Best is the Cheapest<br />
A Great Bargain in Hats<br />
By Right of Conquest<br />
For Love and Honor<br />
</p>

<p>A line of capitals containing an abbreviation or other
short word should have capitals throughout when possible,
as in the second form of these examples:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
JOHN SMITH, Jr.  <span style="margin-left: 5em;">JOHN SMITH, JR.</span><br />
ROBINSON &amp; Co.  <span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">ROBINSON &amp; CO.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In advertisement display lines like the following are
permissible:</p>


<div class="blockquot" style="width: 12em;">
<p class="center">
The GOLDEN HARVESTER<br />
REGAL SHOES <i>for</i> <span class="smcap">Men</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Combinations of different sizes and styles of types are
also common and serve their purpose properly, as in this
style, often used in billheads, etc.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap">to THOMAS W. ABBOTT, dr.</span><br />
<i>In account with</i> FRANK ABBOTT<br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Combinations of large and small capitals and lower-case
like the following are, however, not approved:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">william brown</span>, President</p></div>

<p>The words in small capitals as well as the word in lower-case
should begin with large capitals, like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">William Brown</span>, President</p></div>

<p>When lines of capitals are used in books and pamphlets,
for headings and display, they should be used consistently&mdash;that
is, all headings of a similar kind should be alike in any
piece of work, and not one heading in capitals and another
in lower-case. The composition of a title page is more
pleasing when its chief lines are in one style of letters,
giving a harmonious effect. When lines of capitals and
lines of lower-case are interspersed in a page an appearance
of confusion is liable to be the result.</p>

<h2><a name="QUESTIONS" id="QUESTIONS"></a>QUESTIONS</h2>


<p>As the subject matter of this book is such that many of the questions
will serve only to bring out the accuracy of the pupil&rsquo;s memory of
rules it is very desirable that care should be taken to insure intelligent
use and application of the rules. To be able to repeat a rule is of very
little importance compared with the ability to apply it intelligently.</p>

<p>The instructor should give the pupils constant practice in the application
of these rules. This should consist of;&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em;">(a) Study of passages taken from all kinds of printed matter.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em;">(b) Rewriting of passages given out without capitalization.</p>

<p>In the first case a wide range of material should be used from the
most carefully printed books to the most carelessly printed matter that
can be found, including newspapers of varying excellence and pure
advertising matter. The capitalization found should be studied and
explained by the rules and the criticisms or changes suggested justified
in the same way.</p>

<p>In like manner in the second case every capital used in the rewritten
text should be justified by the proper rule.</p>

<p>Without such exercises as these, the book will have comparatively
little value.</p>

<h2><a name="ACKNOWLEDGMENT" id="ACKNOWLEDGMENT"></a>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>


<p>This series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the
splendid co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals
engaged in the printing business and its allied industries
in the United States of America.</p>

<p>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of
America, under whose auspices the books have been prepared and
published, acknowledges its indebtedness for the generous assistance
rendered by the many authors, printers, and others identified
with this work.</p>

<p>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright
pages of those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless
felt that a group list of co-operating firms would be of
interest.</p>

<p>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who
have co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes,
constituting the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books
comprising the Typographic Technical Series has been completed
(which the Committee hopes will be at an early date), the full list
will be printed in each volume.</p>

<p>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to
the many subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its
publication.</p>
